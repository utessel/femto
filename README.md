femto is a serial, full featured generic bootloader
(usable at least for tiny2313)

Features:
  - requires hardware USART
  - uses Watchdog 
  - still smaller than 128 bytes
  - allows to read the flash and fuses
  - allows to read and write the EEPROM
  and, of course: 
  - allows to flash new code (and set fuses)

Special thanks:
ideas found everywhere, but especially to Ralph Duncaster for his picoboot.
